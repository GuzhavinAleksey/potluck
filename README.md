# potluck

This project contains FreeBSD *pot* (pkg install pot) flavours which are regularly built with Jenkins.

To learn about pot, go to [pot.pizzamig.dev](https://pot.pizzamig.dev)).

To learn how to use these pot flavours & images (spoiler alert: it is just one command...), go to [potluck.honeyguide.net](https://potluck.honeyguide.net).

*Please note:*

**Additional flavours or fixes/updates to existing flavours are very welcome via pull requests!**
